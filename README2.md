# 3 Space Defence 2
For this assignment we are going to continue with the space defence game, adding the finishing touches to turn Space Defence into a real game. Make sure to hand in Space Defence 1 before continuing with the new assignment.

To expand the game we increase the playing area beyond the screen, we add more enemies, another weapon and a new mechanic, where the player can score by shipping goods between 2 planets.

All the sprites you need can be found in the assets folder, but you are also free to use your own!

### Functionality:
Implement the following functionality:

#### Add a start and pause screen:
1. Add a start screen to the game from where the player can at least start or quit the game. (0.5p)
2. Add a pause screen from where the player can at least continue or quit the game. The game should still be visible in the background, but not be updated.  (0.5p)

#### Expand the level:
1. Create a camera class that follows the player as it moves around the level and expand the play area. (1 p)

#### More enemies:
1. Add a new asteroid enemy that does not move, and destroys both the player and enemies on touch. (0.5p)
2. Spawn more enemies over time, slowly ramping up the difficulty. (0.5p)

#### Animations:
1. Implement a class that can play an animation using a sprite sheet. (0.5p)
2. It should at least be possible to adjust the speed of the animation and whether or not it loops in the class.
3. Whenever a player or an alien dies, play an explosion animation (0.5p)

#### Game Goal (HUD):
1. Add at least 2 planets to the level. When the player goes to one planet, they pick up cargo. At the other planet they can drop it off. (0.5p)
2. Whenever the player drops off cargo they score points. The score should always be visible on screen. (HUD) (1p)
3. There should always be some indication of whether or not the player is carrying any cargo. (HUD) (1p)

#### New Weapon:
1. Extract a weapon class for the two current weapons that can be added to the ship as a component to the ship. (1p)
2. Add a third weapon, the player can pick up. (0.5)
3. Add some unique functionality to the weapon. You can decide what it does. It can for example be an explosion, or a lightning weapon that also hits nearby targets (1p)

#### Expand the Game:
Add something new to the game of your choosing. For example: 
-  More enemy types (.5-2p depending on complexity of the enemies)
-  Health bars (~1p for health bars that follow both enemies and the player)
-  Weapon upgrades (1-2p depending on depth)

Add a short description of what you added. You can get up to 2 points depending on complexity 

You can get a maximum of 11 points for this assignment.

The final grade for Space defence is (your points for the first part + the second part) /2 with a maximum of 10
